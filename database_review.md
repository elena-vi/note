### Why delete??

- temporary_users: 
	- not in use
	- should have never been created
	- just why??
- activity_stream_items
	- not been used since 2017-06-05
	- this table could potentially be used for something else
- user_events
	- left over from events/opportunities refactor work
	- table could be used for something more useful
- opportunities, opportunities_skills, opportunity_interests, events
	- not needed, refactored into roles
- vinspired_live, rockstar
	- looks like some sort of special signup table, doesn't seem to be used
- JLGB_awards
	- special award for some partner
	- not been used since 2015-10-30
	- *data should be migrated into a generic awards table or something* 
- dosomething_campaigns
	- not in use
	- PURGE!
- ratings
	- great idea for ranking roles (events at the time), but doesn't seem to have ever been in use
	- delete and recreate when we want to proprely introduce something like this
- a2dominion_postcodes
	- special partner postcodes
	- probably not in use any more
